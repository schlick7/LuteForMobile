clicking empty space/background (Anywhere without text) always triggers a close tooltip command. When a ontap is triggered it always sends out a close all tooltip command then continues on with the normal ontap method. when a tooltip is open it should not block or consume ANY tap events


add accent color theme option
  - one for buttons
  - one for labels?


Have the hamburger menu show 2 columns. The left column is only icons and allows naviagtion between views (Reader, Settings, (more later)). The right column is always the current views settings. Also add the hamburger menu to the settings screen (settings view will only have the 1 column so we need to handle that properly)

add an accent label color that is a copy of the color used for the text. Then make sure all textbox labels use the label color theme.
