clicking empty space/background (Anywhere without text) always triggers a close tooltip command. When a ontap is triggered it always sends out a close all tooltip command then continues on with the normal ontap method. when a tooltip is open it should not block or consume ANY tap events


add parents and parent linking
- if parent doesn't exist create the parent term in database
- auto link term when adding parent
 - use parents status if it has one
- double tap opens term form of parent - WITHOUT closeing/canceling the orignal termform. Closing parent termform returns you to the termform you came from. 

compact style text boxs with the labels built into the border to save space.

add accent color theme option
  - one for buttons
  - one for labels?
