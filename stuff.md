Change opacity for termlist

Is all values getting saved correctly? Some seem to reset after a server stop/start and other don't

*fixed?
I get this message over and over none stop if I don't have a book selected for the Reader. Is ther any way to stop this and only have this action run if there is a book active in the reader?
DEBUG SentenceReaderScreen._monitorAndInitialize: isLoading=false, hasPageData=false, _hasInitialized=false
js_primitives.dart:28 DEBUG SentenceReaderScreen._monitorAndInitialize: Waiting for data, will retry...
js_primitives.dart:28 DEBUG SentenceReaderScreen._monitorAndInitialize called


Future:
- add a toggle to book details to select between Server parsing or App parsing
  - include hint
  - put this in the edit button and move the confirmation to the edit button popup for editing the term.
