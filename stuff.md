clicking empty space/background (Anywhere without text) always triggers a close tooltip command. When a ontap is triggered it always sends out a close all tooltip command then continues on with the normal ontap method. when a tooltip is open it should not block or consume ANY tap events

Status shouldn't be a drop down. It should be 6 tapable buttons in this order. status 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, known(checkmark symbol), ignore (x). status 1-5 should display the numbers only and the color should match what the theme status colors are. known should show a checkmark instead of its number and also be the status color. ignored should just show the X. The current status should be highlighed. Clicking any status should changed the highlight to that status and the term should be updated to that status if the user presses save

rename fieldsettings to something like termformsettings
