Change opacity for termlist

Is all values getting saved correctly? Some seem to reset after a server stop/start and other don't





Future:
- add a toggle to book details to select between Server parsing or App parsing
  - include hint
  - put this in the edit button and move the confirmation to the edit button popup for editing the term.
